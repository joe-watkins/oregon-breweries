# Oregon Breweries

_A list of major & minor beer producers in Oregon_

This is a fun personal project to list all the great places to taste Oregon beer. There’s a [corollary web page](http://swashcap.com/oregon-breweries/) complete with a Google map showing locations. Boom!

## Making the cut.

Here are a rough list of requirements:

* The location must be in Oregon (duh).
* _Brewed_ beverages – beer or cider – only. (I’m holding off on mead for now.)
* The spot is a brewery or associated tasting room. Beer must be made there.
* It’s gotta be a public space with operating hours.

## Spot a mistake? See something missing?

Is your favorite tasting room not listed? Catch a wrong address? Either message me on Twitter ([@swashcap](https://twitter.com/swashcap)) or [add a new issue](./issues/new) and I’ll get on it.
